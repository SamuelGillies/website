      <h1>Capitalist Realism: 10 Years On</h1><hr style="width:80%"><br>
    <p>In 2009, Mark Fisher published Capitalist Realism, an exploration of cultural product born from the seeming
      impossibility of any alternative to the established political and economic system of capitalism. In it, he
      establishes the key tensions manifested by a culture, artistic and otherwise, that has no alternative but to
      function within capitalist structures. Thus, culture becomes a mirror through which to understand and interpret
      these more nebulous political and economic forces.
      <br><br>
      Ten years on and circumstances under late-capitalism continue to transform in ways Fisher could never have
      anticipated. From the rise of socialist figures Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the
      emergence of the gig economy, to the complex and multifaceted reactions to the socioeconomic structures of our
      world that are Brexit and Trump. Meanwhile some of Fisher’s most enduring observations remain just as problematic
      today: the reduced power and the increased bureaucratisation of our public institutions, the ambiguous function of
      learning and further education, the increased productisation of creative thought and culture, the economic
      dominance of nostalgia, and rising mental health issues, simultaneously born from capitalism and ineffectively
      treated under it.
      <br><br>
      As Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge highlight, “[Capitalist Realism’s] potential lies in its ability to
      address the limitations of postmodernism and to connect the postmodern more powerfully to the features of our
      contemporary political economic moment.” The Centre for Research in New Music (CeReNeM) will host a two-day
      symposium in February to reflect upon cultural products of the last ten years to gain some insight into the
      contemporary state of capitalist realism. What observations can be made from culture from the 2010’s as it relates
      to Fisher’s original text? How has capitalist realism been challenged over the last decade? What avenues have
      emerged to challenge the dominant narrative of culture under capitalism? And where do our current cultural
      products indicate where we are heading and what are the possibilities for creating change?
